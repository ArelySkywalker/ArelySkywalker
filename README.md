### About Me

I'm a passionate **Software Engineer** with over 8 years of experience in building responsive, dynamic web applications. I specialize in **frontend development**, using modern JavaScript frameworks like **React** and **TypeScript**. I currently work at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, where I lead projects that improve scalability, security, and user experiences for millions of customers.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me mentoring students in STEM, contributing to the **M.E.S.A. Club**, or teaching STEM courses at the **Latino Youth Summit** at UW Madison. I love solving problems, learning new technologies, and building projects that help users in meaningful ways.
